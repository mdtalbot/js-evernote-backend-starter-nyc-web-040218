### Welcome!

This is the back end for Tinynote, a simple note-taking app that I built using React and Rails. For the front end, see https://github.com/mdtalbot/tinynote-frontend.  

### Motivation

This app was created mostly just to sharpen my React skills, as well as help me delve further into Semantic UI. The fact that it also helps keep me organized is a bonus.

### Libraries and Frameworks Used

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
* [Moment](https://momentjs.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Features

- [x] Allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes.
- [x] Contains a search bar for easy retrieval of notes from the database.
- [ ] (WIP) Sorts notes by the date they were created or date they were updated.
